summary: A check book appplication developed using C/C++. Creating methods, functions, database and usin uer input to provide a working check book application.
---

The Check Book project was executed using C/C++, the second programming language I’ve come to familiarize with. The application serves as a database, storing user’s check data and transactions, all using user input. The user is able to select options within the menu, add a check, search the database to find a check using the check number, print the whole database or checkbook and quit the applications.

I was able learn C/C++ quicker due to my previous experience learning Java. I was relieved and intrigued to find similarities between the two programming languages, and hopeful that most programming languages will also share some similarities. Looking back, working on this project made it apparently clear of the importance of good coding and my faults and weaknesses as a programmer. Having caught up with the bigger picture or the overall objective, hindered me from allocating each problem into separate pages, classes, functions or methods. Stubbornly placing the whole app into one class or page, made it clear how inefficient my application was. Dividing the problem to smaller problems made it easier to understanding how each component works to come together to meet the main goal. Despite my shortcomings, I found that debugging and anticipating weaknesses in the system was surprisingly fun, which was implemented using exception handling.
