summary: My first project created by java.
---

My first exposure to making a fully formed and working application was in my first ICS class, where I learned the Java. Never having any experience in coding, the learning curve to learning my very first programming language was steep and slow moving. The experience was truly invaluable given that it gave me the foundations to quickly learn other programming languages rather quickly. 

This project incapsulates all that was learned in the course, from defining and executing variable’s, creating loops, arrays, classes and methods to familiarizing with object hierarchy and inheritance in java. What really caught my interest throughout this project however is learning about UI, user interface, and using it to facilitate and enhancing user’s experience. I’ve always been in love with art and design and to merge it with coding, was just the icing on a cake.

To Catch a Pokemon is a playable Pokedex game, where players are able to discover wild Pokemons using the “hunt” button and catch them using the “catch” button. If the catch is successful, the player is able to read the stats i.e. the Pokemon data along with previously caught Pokemons.
