## Things I've Learned Through My Failures In Just These Past Two Weeks

*“A designer is a planner with an aesthetic sense.”* - Bruno Munari, Design as Art

A functional and esthetically pleasing website or application is very important, not just for a good first impression but for an intuitive, “easy to use” user experience. After all, the easier your website is to use, the more people will use it. These past two weeks has been dedicated in learning HTML, CSS and the Semantic UI Framework, to make intuitive and esthetically pleasing websites.

The design aspects of computer science always give me the feeling of both excitement and dread. This is because I love designing and also because I know how I am working with design, obsessive with no respect for time management, in the least. As the days coming to these past two weeks unfurled, I prepared myself. I set out a game plan, hoping that working with HTML, CSS and UI Frameworks won’t trigger any of my ADHD tendencies and cost me any more points off of my grade. Here is a record, chronicling how I have done that and how I failed.


### Learning Curve

Learning HTML & CSS was a breeze, given my prior experience in tinkering with the language in my early teenage years. Without giving away my age, it rhymes with “my face”. Despite my familiarity, it was nice to get a refresher and to learn a few new things from going through the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/" alt="HTML">HTML</a> & <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css/" alt="CSS">CSS</a> lessons provided in freecodecamp.org.

Using just the HTML and CSS language alone to make a responsive and beautiful website is difficult, unless the objective is to make it look dated. Many hours and late nights would have saved me if Semantic UI was introduced to me earlier on. Semantic UI allows designers to code with easy-to-understand human language, providing pre-built components to build responsive and modern websites. Having gone through the courses provide in <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/semantic-ui-2-0" alt="PluralSight">PluralSight</a>, I still found myself guessing and adding words hoping it’s the right variable to do what I want it to do. An attestation to how easy it is use, it’s always a delight to find out that my silly guesses work.

### Must Have Tools

If your anything like me, susceptible to being sucked into the rabbit hole of web designing. Then you’ll need these must have tools with you if you care to maintain your sanity and your free time free.

* 	<b><a href="https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/getting-started.html" alt="Semantic UI Documentation">Semantic UI Documentation</a>:</b> Although one may go through websites design through guesses, by all means do it if it works. But building a website using Semantic UI is not all idiot proof. In fact, you’ll find guessing is a huge waste of time, and a lot of headaches than going through the proper channels to find exactly the variable or component to use.
