### Pidgin


Pidgin is a significant tool of unity, defiance, and an identifier of local nativity. Historically, Pidgin developed 
as a lingua franca between Hawaiians, English speakers and immigrants. The push to advocate standard English in schools,
resulted in using Pidgin emerging as an act of defiance to social, education and political reform. In the present day, 
Pidgin or Hawaiian Creole English (HCE) is an identifier of local nativity. However, the implementation of standard 
English in the educational system, coupled with resurgence of the Hawaiian language within a community of English-
speaking elites, placed HCE speakers in an unfortunate situation as an undervalued minority. 
	
Early stages of the mass immigration to Hawaii necessitated the creation of a lingua franca (common tongue), 
incorporating broken Hawaiian, English and a few borrowed worlds of the languages of immigrants. This language is called 
Pidgin, a language developed in a situation where speakers of different languages create a common language in order to 
communicate. At this stage, Pidgin is only spoken as a 2nd or 3rd language by its speakers. Overtime, the language grew 
more complex, developing grammar structures and a lexicon that drew from a population of different languages and cultures. 
Interracial mingling and marriages resulted in a new generation of locally-born kids, most of whom adopted Pidgin as their 
1st language. This inter-generational continuity of language helped pidgin transcend to the status of a creole language. 
It’s intriguing to learn that, through necessity, the petri dish of separate distinct cultures and languages unified, 
through adoption of words and grammar from each others’ languages, to produce a distinct, yet mutually intelligible 
common language. This cultural and linguistic mixing created local culture and the language they used to communicate 
helped them identify as a native population representing Hawaii’s melting pot of cultures. 
	
An article called, “Pondering Pidgin”,by Michael Tsai, gave a stark reminder of the consequences of disseminating a 
culture. Just as how Native Hawaiians showed defiance in the social, educational, and political reform of replacing a 
local language with a foreign one, so did the Hawaiian Creole English-speaking natives. The ban on speaking Hawaiian 
in school may have ensured the growth of HCE speakers. Consequently, HCE flourished as a new identity of local 
nativity. Hawaiians eventually, through resilience to outside pressure, gave way to a resurgence of the Hawaiian 
language, and regained its status as one of Hawaii’s official co-equal languages, legally equal to that of English. 
A systemic decreolization preceded afterwards as a result of implementing efforts to teach Standard English in the 
educational system. The misconception of HCE as a subcategory of English instead of a separate individual language, 
resulted in the inability and refusal to use HCE in the classroom to teach English to HCE-speakers. HCE-speakers grew 
irate and resentful of a system that downplays HCE natives 1st language, coupled with a growing immigrant community and 
a flourishing tourism industry, lead the HCE-speaking populace to further embrace the creole language as a means to 
promote social unity through exclusion. This further advanced the negative social and political stigma surrounding the 
HCE-speakers, resulting in self-loathing and an inferiority complex amongst some individuals of the HCE-speaking 
population. As new immigrants assimilate through the HCE language, and the need to differentiate themselves from 
tourist continues, the Hawaiian Creole English Language-speaking community will only continue to grow. This makes me 
wonder, how can we better address the negative stigma that creates such hopelessness and powerlessness of our people?
  
In the hanabata days, I too was an immigrant who only new a few words in English. Broken English became a means to 
connect with my local born cousins who speak HCE. Eventually, through my cousins and classmates, I learned it well 
enough to speak HCE. As I grew to an adolescent, the struggle some HCE students have within school was apparent. I 
grew aware that some of my peers through hushed words would deter us from associating from a particular group. I 
distinctly remember, in my print-making class, a class full of immigrant decent HCE speakers, who were well-versed in 
both English and modern Pidgin. There was one student who spoke in a thicker form of Pidgin, Hawaiian Pidgin English. 
She was seen as a dangerous and dull individual, easily angered, and so the class would steer clear away from her. The 
teacher ended up partnering us together, afraid of being in a confrontational situation and even more afraid of being 
humiliated and pushed around. I managed by standing firm by talking to her as if she was my younger sibling in my 
limited HCE and helped her get better acquainted with our curricular activity. To my astonishment and relief, she 
replied responsively and we became friendly acquaintances. It was nice feeling being connected with someone, as I’ve 
always felt like the runt in my class who was relatively-less well versed in both English and Pidgin, but situation 
such as these made deciding which language I needed to be fluent to, easier. Already being horrible in English, I was 
more afraid of poor educational and career prospects, so I chose standard English, and connections with my HCE peers 
grew strained. 
	
That said, I would like HCE to be spoken formally, as in reading and writing in schools. Standard English is still 
the language of business and politics in Hawaii, but HCE should be used to teach the HCE-speakers Standard English, 
just as you would teach a French student English in French. Either that, or treat HCE as a co-equal language of 
business and politics within Hawaii, but even that would limit HCE speaking individuals confined in only thriving 
within the borders of the islands. Although I have deliberately embraced Standard English for personal and academic 
reasons, this haven’t stopped me from growing or keeping connections between my immediate and extended family, who 
opted to speak HCE as their 1st language. These articles have given me a better understanding of the social and 
systematic prejudice they go through, which was not visible to me until now, and made it clearer why they did not 
flourish in the educational system as much as individuals who embraced Standard English. I remembered my younger 
brother’s tantrums in elementary school because they could not express their thoughts and feelings in English to their 
peers, and I find it a similar situation regarding my HCE speaking cousins and friends, who show downright defiance 
against pursuing higher education because of being systematically ostracized, resulting in a skewed self-perception of 
being inferior and dull. This makes me feel concerned; as more immigrants come to Hawaii, they will settle and give 
birth to 2nd generation of HCE natives, and those children will have to pick between local identity and its sense of 
belongingness, or educational and career prospects. This is an unsettling decision, and that’s only if they realize 
that there’s a decision to make. This decision should not at all be essential if social and systematic stigma wasn’t so 
prevalent in their lives. That’s why, despite the obstacles and history, I would like HCE to be spoken formally, as in 
reading and writing in schools.
