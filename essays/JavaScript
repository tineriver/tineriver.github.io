## Learning A New Language : JavaScript

  Learning a new language is always hard, often times it takes years. But just like human languages once you learn one 
and move on to another quite similar to the one before, often you’ll find that it has become a lot easier. This was 
the case when I started learning French, taking my knowledge of the roman language Spanish that has heavily influenced 
my native language, Tagalog, and the language I’m most fluent in, English, I’ve found that a little of those two 
languages can look a bit similar to French. With other computer languages under my belt, Java and C++, learning 
Javascript has been a similar experience. 
  
  As I go through the coding boot camp, freecodecamp.org, I noticed many similarities Javascript has with Java. I was
pleasantly surprised at the ease and pace at which information I could take in. At the same time, discovering the 
differences and advantages of using Javascript has over Java was quite exhilarating. “Finally, a computer language 
that’s so much easier to work with!” I thought. No more convoluted, 100’s lines of code just to implement a child class 
from a parent class, just to update a variable. 
  
  As fun as learning what JavaScript can do, there was many hurdles and many new things to learn as well. As I come ever 
closer to the end of the tutorial, I find myself struggling to understand the material. This was new territory. As 
intuitive as Javascript is compared to Java or C++, there are still many things to learn. I found myself clicking the 
hint button more and more, and mental notes to go over certain exercises in the future. I spent more time on the 
tutorial associated with Deconstruction, it’s a new thing for me. As devastating it is for me to learn that it’s just 
as challenging to learn JavaScript as it has been learning Java, It’s comforting to know that I have been down this 
road before and I know, eventually, I’ll get it.
