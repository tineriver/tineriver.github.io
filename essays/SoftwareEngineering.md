My journey in learning software development started out pretty rocky. I did not anticipate how much work and time one has to put into making a functional and intuitive application, especially for a rookie like myself. Understanding and hopefully someday, professionally navigating the intricacies of software design won’t be so mentally taxing and labor intensive. Fortunately for myself, I’ve come to be familiar with fundamental software engineering concepts that are invaluable to helping me learn and develop skills in constructing web applications that has long been sitting in my head for a while now.

## Open Source Software Development

As a student, the abundant resources available online is both a blessing and a privilege. This allows would be aspiring designers and also professionals to learn from, freely modify or incorporate already made open-source projects into larger projects. This facilitates innovations and promotes a free exchange of ideas within the software designing community. Having learned of this concept, makes it possible for me to learn from other designers and incorporating their ideas to mine. I already have an eye out on a few GitHub projects:

* [Simple Coin](https://github.com/cosme12/SimpleCoin)
* [Raspberry-Pi-Gaming-Console](https://github.com/AHueya/Raspberry-Pi-Gaming-Console)

They may be above my current skill sets, but I can already pinpoint some aspects of their code I am somewhat familiar with. It’s always better to start from the bottom and work your way up, hence, the upcoming summer break will consists of me going through open-source projects available in GitHub to modify and incorporate to my many web application ideas.
