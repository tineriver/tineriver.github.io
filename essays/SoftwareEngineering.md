My journey in learning software development started out pretty rocky. I did not anticipate how much work and time one has to put into making a functional and intuitive application, especially for a rookie like myself. Understanding and hopefully someday, professionally navigating the intricacies of software design won’t be so mentally taxing and labor intensive. Fortunately for myself, I’ve come to be familiar with fundamental software engineering concepts that are invaluable to helping me learn and develop skills in constructing web applications that has long been sitting in my head for a while now. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40307136/118350476-aea3fc80-b4f2-11eb-9bcc-7d1a04844a68.png)
